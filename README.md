Paper: A Study of Distant Viewing of Ukiyo-e Prints with Natural Language Preprocessing 

This paper presents a small dataset with inscriptions of ukiyo-e landscape prints that have been annotated by an art historian
for included place-name entities. Our dataset is released for public use. By fine-tuning and applying a Japanese BERT-based
Name Entity Recogniser, we provide a use-case of a macroanalysis of a visual dataset that is hosted by the digital database
of the Art Research Center at the Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto. Our work studies the relationship between topography and
its visual renderings in early modern Japanese ukiyo-e landscape prints, exhibiting how can the work of the art historian be
facilitated with Natural Language Processing towards distant viewing visual datasets.
